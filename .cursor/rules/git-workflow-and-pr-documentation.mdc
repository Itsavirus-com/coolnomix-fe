# Git Workflow & Pull Request Documentation Rules

You are working on a Next.js TypeScript project with strict git workflow and documentation requirements. Always follow these rules when creating branches, commits, and pull request documentation.

## Workflow Requirements

### Before Creating Any Commit

**ALWAYS check branch compatibility first:**

1. **Check Current Branch Scope**
   - Analyze the current branch name and its intended scope
   - Compare with the new commit type and scope
   - Determine if they are compatible

2. **Branch Compatibility Rules**
   - **If commit matches current branch scope**: Commit directly to current branch
   - **If commit has different scope**: Create new branch for the commit
   - **Examples of compatible scopes**:
     - `feat/user-dashboard` + `feat: add dashboard charts` ✅ (same feature scope)
     - `fix/login-error` + `fix: resolve validation issue` ✅ (same fix scope)
     - `docs/api-guide` + `docs: update API examples` ✅ (same docs scope)
   - **Examples of incompatible scopes**:
     - `feat/user-dashboard` + `fix: resolve login error` ❌ (different scope)
     - `docs/readme-update` + `feat: add new component` ❌ (different type)
     - `refactor/auth-service` + `style: format components` ❌ (different purpose)

### When User Requests Branch and Commit Creation

**ALWAYS provide these components based on compatibility check:**

**If Compatible (same scope):**
1. **Git Operations**
   - Commit directly to current branch
   - Push to existing remote branch

**If Incompatible (different scope):**
1. **Git Operations**
   - Create new branch with proper naming convention
   - Commit with conventional commit format
   - Push to new remote repository

2. **Pull Request Title**
   - Keep concise and descriptive

3. **Pull Request Description**
   - Follow the specified template format
   - Include brief but clear documentation

## Branch Compatibility Check Process

### Step 1: Analyze Current Branch
```bash
# Check current branch name
git branch --show-current

# Examples:
# feat/user-dashboard -> Feature scope: user dashboard
# fix/payment-error -> Fix scope: payment issues  
# docs/api-guide -> Documentation scope: API
# refactor/auth-logic -> Refactor scope: authentication
```

### Step 2: Analyze New Commit
```bash
# Determine commit type and scope from changes
# Examples:
# "feat: add dashboard charts" -> Feature scope: dashboard (compatible with feat/user-dashboard)
# "fix: resolve login validation" -> Fix scope: login (incompatible with feat/user-dashboard)
```

### Step 3: Make Decision
- **Same scope**: Continue with current branch
- **Different scope**: Create new branch

## Pull Request Documentation Template

### Title Format
Short and descriptive title

### Description Format
```markdown
## Summary
Brief overview of what was changed and why

## Changes
- **File/Component changed**: Short explanation of what was modified
- **Another change**: Brief description of the modification
- **Additional change**: Concise explanation of the update
```

## Documentation Standards

### Summary Section
- One or two sentences explaining the overall purpose
- Focus on the main goal of the changes

### Changes Section
- List each significant change as a bullet point
- Use format: **What was changed**: Brief explanation
- Keep explanations concise but clear
- Focus on the most important modifications

## Example Implementation

```markdown
## Pull Request for `feat/user-dashboard`

### **Title:**
```
Add user dashboard with statistics
```

### **Description:**
```markdown
## Summary
Added a new user dashboard component with data visualization and user statistics to improve user experience.

## Changes
- **DashboardLayout component**: Created responsive layout with navigation
- **UserStats component**: Added statistics display with charts
- **Dashboard routing**: Implemented protected routes for dashboard access
- **TypeScript interfaces**: Added type definitions for dashboard data
```

## Automation Rules

### For Every Commit Request:

1. **Check Branch Compatibility**
   ```bash
   # Current branch: feat/user-dashboard
   # New commit: "feat: add dashboard filters"
   # Decision: Compatible ✅ -> Commit to current branch
   
   # Current branch: feat/user-dashboard  
   # New commit: "fix: resolve API timeout"
   # Decision: Incompatible ❌ -> Create new branch
   ```

2. **Execute Git Operations Based on Compatibility**
   
   **If Compatible:**
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "<conventional-commit-message>"
   git push
   ```
   
   **If Incompatible:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <type>/<description>
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "<conventional-commit-message>"
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

3. **Generate PR Documentation (only for new branches)**
   - Use the concise template format
   - Keep explanations brief but clear
   - Focus on key changes only

### Quality Standards
- **Branch Logic**: Always check compatibility before creating new branches
- **Brevity**: Keep explanations short and to the point
- **Clarity**: Ensure each change is clearly explained
- **Relevance**: Only include significant changes
- **Consistency**: Follow the same format for every PR

## Integration with Development Workflow
- Apply branch compatibility check for ALL commit requests
- Maintain logical branch organization
- Avoid unnecessary branch proliferation
- Support efficient code review process

## Template Reusability
This workflow should be used for all types of changes while maintaining branch logic and clarity.
