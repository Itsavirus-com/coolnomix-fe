# Git Workflow and Pull Request Guidelines

This document outlines the Git workflow and standards for this project. Following these rules ensures a clean, maintainable, and collaborative development history.

## 1. Core Principles

- **One Logical Change per Pull Request:** Each PR should represent a single, self-contained logical change (e.g., one feature, one bug fix).
- **Group Related Files:** Group logically related file changes into a single branch and PR. Do not commit unrelated changes together. If you have multiple independent changes, create separate branches for each.
- **Main Branch:** The `dev` branch is the main integration branch. It must always be stable.

---

## 2. Branching Strategy

### A. Branch Naming Convention

All branch names must follow this format:

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

- **Types:** `feature`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`, `style`, `ci`, `hotfix`
- **Short Description:**
  - Use kebab-case (e.g., `user-dashboard`).
  - Keep it concise (max 30 characters).
  - **Examples:**
    - `feature/user-dashboard`
    - `fix/payment-timeout`
    - `refactor/auth-logic`

### B. Creating Branches

- **Independent Changes:** For new, independent work (e.g., a new feature or a bug fix unrelated to other ongoing work), always create your branch from `dev`.
  ```bash
  git checkout dev
  git pull origin dev
  git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>
  ```
- **Dependent Changes (Stacked PRs):** If your work depends on changes in another feature branch (that is not yet merged into `dev`), create your branch from that feature branch.
  ```bash
  git checkout feature/base-branch
  git pull
  git checkout -b feature/dependent-branch
  ```

### C. Stacked PR Maintenance

- If a base branch (e.g., `feature/base-branch`) is merged into `dev`, you must rebase your dependent branch onto `dev` before creating a pull request. This keeps the history linear and avoids unnecessary merge commits.
  ```bash
  git checkout feature/dependent-branch
  git rebase dev
  ```

---

## 3. Committing Changes

### A. Commit Message Format

All commit messages must follow the @Conventional Commits specification.

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

- **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `style`, `perf`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `hotfix`
- **Scope (optional):** A noun describing the section of the codebase affected (e.g., `auth`, `ui`, `api`).
- **Description:**
  - Use imperative mood (e.g., "add" not "added" or "adds").
  - Keep it concise (max 50 characters).
  - Do not end with a period.
- **Examples:**
  ```
  feat: add user dashboard
  fix(ui): resolve button alignment
  refactor(auth): simplify user login logic
  ```

### B. Pre-Commit Review Process

Before committing, follow these steps to ensure changes are reviewed correctly:

1.  **Check Status:** Always start by checking the repository status.
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
2.  **Review Staged Files:** If there are files in the staging area ("Changes to be committed"), unstage them to review them individually.
    ```bash
    git reset
    ```
3.  **Inspect Changes:** Review the changes in each file one by one using `git diff`.
    ```bash
    git diff <path/to/file>
    ```
4.  **Stage and Commit:** Once reviewed, stage the desired files.

5.  **Final Consistency Check:**
    - After reviewing all files and staging your changes, run:
      ```bash
      git diff --staged
      ```
    - **If all staged changes are consistent with the context described by the branch name:**
      Commit directly.
    - **If the staged changes contain unrelated or logically separate contexts:**
      Create a new branch from the current branch for the unrelated changes, and commit them separately.

## 4. Pull Requests

### A. PR Title and Description

- **Title:** The PR title must be different from the Git commit message. Keep it short, clear, and descriptive, summarizing the change.
- **Description:** Use the following template to explain the changes.

```markdown
## Summary
A brief overview of what was changed and why.

## Changes
- **File/Component changed**: Short explanation of what was modified.
- **Another change**: Brief description of the modification.
```

### B. Documentation Standards

- **Summary:** Explain the "why" behind the change in one or two sentences.
- **Changes:** List the most significant changes. Be specific but concise.
- **Clarity:** Ensure the description is easy to understand for all team members.

### C. Target Branch

- **Primary Target:** All pull requests should target the `dev` branch.
- **Protected Branches:** Do not open pull requests directly against `main` or `staging`. These branches are updated through controlled merges from `dev`.

---

## 5. Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Independent Change
- **Task:** Add a new, independent feature.
- **Workflow:**
  1. Create a branch `feature/new-feature` from `dev`.
  2. Make commits following the commit message format.
  3. Push the branch and open a PR to merge into `dev`.

### Scenario 2: Stacked PR (Dependent Change)
- **Task:** Work on a feature (`feature/part-2`) that depends on another (`feature/part-1`).
- **Workflow:**
  1. Create branch `feature/part-1` from `dev`.
  2. Complete work on `feature/part-1` and open a PR.
  3. Create branch `feature/part-2` from `feature/part-1`.
  4. Complete work on `feature/part-2` and open a PR to merge into `feature/part-1`.
  5. Once `feature/part-1` is merged into `dev`, rebase `feature/part-2` onto `dev` and update its PR to target `dev`.
